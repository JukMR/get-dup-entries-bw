# Bitwarden duplicated keys

This repository has a script which gets the entries which seems to be duplicated in a bitwarden export. This is useful
if you accidently duplicated you vault while doing exports and imports and have many entries duplicated in your db. 

NOTE: this script only show you which entries are duplicated but doesn't delete anything. You will still need to delete
them in your bitwarden vault.
